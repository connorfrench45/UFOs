# UFOs
## Overview
A website that showcases UFO sightings with several filters
## Functionality
The main meat of this site is the list of UFO sightings and the ability to filter. Currently, the data can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country, or Shape, and it can be filtered by any combination of those filters. If the user wants to look at the whole list again, they can clear the filters or refresh the site via the `UFO Sightings` link at the top of the page. 
Here is an example of what a user would see if they used the filters. Let's say the user filtered the list by looking for all the sightings in California:
![ca search](/Resources/ca_search.PNG)

Then, the user wanted to see all the California sightings that happened on New Year's:
![new year's search](/Resources/new_years_search.PNG)

Finally, the user wanted to look at all the sightings on New Year's:
![ny2](/Resources/new_years_2.PNG)

As you can see, the page is responsive and has many different filters to choose from.
## Future Updates
#### Current Drawbacks
The site is limited and doesn't offer a way to save the filtered table. Also much of the data is corrupted or non-standardized.
#### Potential Updates
This site is effective at its purpose, though its purpose is limited. Here are some directions this project could expand with:
- Adding another search for duration
- Cleaning up and standardizing the data (particularly in the comments column)
- Making a way to save the resulting table
- Updating the site with more UFO related articles
- Updating the sightings to include even more, and update it with new sightings as they happen
